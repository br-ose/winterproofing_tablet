		<h1> The sustainability stewards</h1>
		<a>Because Debs is a sustainability focused house, we have a special position to help ensure that the house lives up to our goals. This position is the sustainability steward! <br> The sustainability steward(s):</a>
		<ul class="introlist">
			<li>Educate the house about issues of sustainability</li>
			<li>Help limit the house's energy use</li>
			<li>Take care of the trash and compost</li>
			<li>Identify areas of wasted resources and work to rectify that waste</li>
			<li>Design a sustainability project to work on each semester!</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<a> Our sustainability stewards this semester are Ben Rose and Dylan Siewert. Look below to check out their bios!</a>

				<h3>About Ben:</h3>
				<a>Hi! My name's Ben! <br> I wanted to become the sustainability steward because I'm majoring in environmental science and I wanted to take what I had learned and use it to make a difference in my house. 
					<br>Hopefully Debs can act as a case study for what works and what doesn't work to help insulate a home and make it more winterproof!</a>

				<h3>About Dylan:</h3>
				<a>Hi my name's Dylan! <br> I wanted to be a sustaibility steward because I was interested in the social justice theme of Debs and sustainability is a part of social justice that I really enjoy. <br> My old neighborhood was really into environmental sustainability so I want to bring that energy into Debs!</a>
