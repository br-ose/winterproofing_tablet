        <h1>Our plan:</h1>
        <br>
        <a>Our goal is to reduce energy costs of the house from heating by 15% in the winter months. We have several different strategies we're going to employ in order to make that goal happen.</a>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>We want to first caulk our windows to make sure no heat escapes from our windows</li>
            <li>Then, we want to incorporate door stoppers to prevent heat from escaping when people enter and exit the house</li>
            <li>After that, we plan on adding plastic sheets covering our windows to make sure even less heat escapes.</li>
            <li>Finally, we plan on lowering the thermostat by one degree just to see how using a little bit less heat is</li>
        </ol>
